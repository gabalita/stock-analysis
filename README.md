# Analyzing Green Energy Stocks 
Uncovering trends in green energy stocks

## Overview of Project
- The purpose of this project was to create a VBA Macro that automates the calculation of yearly trade volume and yearly return of various green stocks. The Macros will help audiences make financial decisions by quickly analyzing thousands of data points worth of stock data. 

## Results

**Stock Performance Comparison Between 2017 and 2018**
- Using our refactored code, we calculated the stock performance for each stock ticker. In general, this selection of stocks did much better across the board in 2017. Only the stocks of ENPH and RUN continued to grow in 2018.

**Measuring VBA Code Performance Between Original and Refactored Code**
- Two types of code were written to perform stock analysis: one that used two for loops, and a refactored code that used an index and an array. Below is each macro's run time for 2017 and 2018 stock data.
